      <h1>Adoption Numbers Unchanged</h1><br>
      <a href="Annotations.htmlPDomeier">By Paul Domeier</a>
      
      <p>The number of adoptions in Nebraska has not changed since abortion issues came to
         the
         forefront of public debate again last year, the executive director of the Nebraska
         Children&#x2019;s Home said. Harris Van Oort said he has not seen a change in the number
         of
         children put up for adoption or in the number of children placed by his agency since
         the
         late 1970&#x2019;s.</p>
      
      <p>The Nebraska Children&#x2019;s Home, a state-wide adoption agency with head- quarters in
         Omaha,
         placed about 225 children in homes each year in the late 1960&#x2019;s, he said.</p>
      
      <p>The number of adoptions dropped in the early 1970&#x2019;s, Van Oort said, after the U.S.
         Supreme Court case Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortion, and because of changing
         social standards. At about the same time as Roe vs. Wade, society accepted the idea
         of
         single mothers, he said.</p>
      
      <p>The affect of single mothers on adop- tons is not easy to trace. Van Oort said. &#x201c;There
         isn&#x2019;t a definite time when it became okay for a young lady to be single and a parent,&#x201d;
         he said.</p>
      
      <p>The number of children placed by the agency slowly dropped and bottomed out at a little
         more than 100 a year by the late 1970&#x2019;s, Van Oort said.</p>
      
      <p> Marcia Blum, the Omaha Child Saving Institute&#x2019;s family service program supervisor,
         said she hasn&#x2019;t noticed any effects of the resurgence in the abortion issue.</p>
      
      <p>She said she thinks that if laws are passed in Nebraska limiting abortion, the number
         of
         children put up for adop- lion would increase.</p>
      
      <p>Van Oort said his agency could handle more children being put up for adoption because
         more Nebraska families want to adopt than there are available children.</p>
