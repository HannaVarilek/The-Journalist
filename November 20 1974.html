      <h1>Clinic will soon offer vasectomy</h1><br>
      By Nancy Stohs
      
      <p>Vasectomies soon will be available to low-income persons free of charge or for a small
         fee at the Planned Parenthood Center, 3830 Adams St.</p>
      
      <p>The cutting of the sperm duct, which takes about 20 minutes, will be available by
         appointment one day a week, Steve White center director said.</p>
      
      <p>Performed by a local urologist or other physician, the operation normally would cost
         from $100 to $150, he said.</p>
      
      <p>Planned Parenthood closed its vasectomy clinic about six months ago because it ran
         out of funds, White said.  It opened in March 1970 on a federal grant for a vasectomy
         counselor.</p>
      
      <p>White said it is being reopened in about a month because he believes there’s a need
         for the operation among low-income persons.</p>
      
      <p>The physician is volunteering his services, so the only expense to the center will
         be the cost of supplies, he said.</p>
      
      <p>White came to Lincoln two months ago from a Planned Parenthood Center in Kansas City,
         Mo.</p>
      
      <p>There, as well as in Nebraska, spouse consent isn’t legally required for either a
         vasectomy or tubal ligation, he said.  Tubal ligation is the sterilization operation
         for women.</p>
      
      <p>Most doctors, however, request it as general practice, to prevent marital problems
         afterward, he said.</p>
      
      <p>Both operations are relatively simple, he said.</p>
      
      <p>Only in a small percentage of cases is either operation reversible, he added.</p>
